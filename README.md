# Deploying a Flask API(scroll down for env_file content )

This is the project starter repo for the course Server Deployment, Containerization, and Testing.

In this project you will containerize and deploy a Flask API to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker, AWS EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild.

The Flask app that will be used for this project consists of a simple API with three endpoints:

- `GET '/'`: This is a simple health check, which returns the response 'Healthy'.
- `POST '/auth'`: This takes a email and password as json arguments and returns a JWT based on a custom secret.
- `GET '/contents'`: This requires a valid JWT, and returns the un-encrpyted contents of that token.

The app relies on a secret set as the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to produce a JWT. The built-in Flask server is adequate for local development, but not production, so you will be using the production-ready [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server when deploying the app.

## Initial setup

1. Fork this project to your Github account.
2. Locally clone your forked version to begin working on the project.

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine
  - Installation instructions for all OSes can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
  - For Mac users, if you have no previous Docker Toolbox installation, you can install Docker Desktop for Mac. If you already have a Docker Toolbox installation, please read [this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) before installing.
- AWS Account
  - You can create an AWS account by signing up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/#).

## Project Steps

Completing the project involves several steps:

1. Write a Dockerfile for a simple Flask API
2. Build and test the container locally
3. Create an EKS cluster
4. Store a secret using AWS Parameter Store
5. Create a CodePipeline pipeline triggered by GitHub checkins
6. Create a CodeBuild stage which will build, test, and deploy your code

For more detail about each of these steps, see the project lesson.
